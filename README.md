# Voter-Simulation-Project
This is the final project for the Wyncode's Ruby class.
The project was created using Ruby's native commands due
to the fact that it was developed in the cloud, which limits access to 
gems and/or files. Should the 
developer had had access to Ruby installed on his/her machine,
gems such as 'colorizer' and libraries such as 'curses' would
have greatly enhanced the visual experience.
